\chapter*{Introduction}

\part{The Effects of Taxation}

The first part of this book is dedicated to the study of the economic effects of taxation. Any tax measure will prompt agents to change their behavior so as to pay less taxes. For instance, an often debated question is that of the negative effect of the income tax on labor supply. We examine in Chapter \ref{ch1_distortions_welfarelosses} the mechanisms that change the main behaviors. We also see there how the social losses induced by taxation can be evaluated.

Social losses are, of course, not borne equally by all agents, and that indeed is a hot-button political issue. Suppose, for instance, that the government decides to raise the VAT on sales of cars. Some effects of such a measure are predictable: car producers will complain that their sales will decrease and car buyers will fear a rise in the price of cars. But who really bears the price of such a rise in VAT, and in what proportions? Chapter \ref{ch2_} studies this question, first in a partial equilibrium, then in a general equilibrium framework.

It is important to understand the contents of both chapters well before moving to the discussion of optimal taxation in the second part of the book.
